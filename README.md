# Simple-Invoice-Extraction-RAG-Application
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application for extracting data from invoices using the Hugging Face embedding models, LangChain framework, FAISS vector database, and Llama 2 hosted on a local server.

## Features

- Extract relevant information from invoice PDFs.
- Leverage Hugging Face embeddings for semantic search.
- Use FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
- Interface with Llama 2 for generating human-like responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For embeddings and model handling.
- **LangChain**: To create the RAG framework.
- **FAISS**: For fast similarity search and retrieval.
- **Llama 2**: To generate responses based on extracted data.
- **Python**: The programming language used.
